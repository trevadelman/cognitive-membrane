# Cognitive Membrane

## Vision
The Cognitive Membrane transforms how we interact with computers by creating an ambient layer of intelligence that understands and adapts to your thought processes. Instead of forcing you to explicitly search for information or switch between tools, it creates a natural, fluid interface that surfaces relevant content and capabilities exactly when you need them - like having an intuitive workspace that anticipates your needs before you have to ask.

## Core Principles

### Ambient Intelligence
The system operates as a natural extension of thought rather than a tool that demands attention. It continuously learns from your work patterns and behaviors without requiring explicit training or configuration, adapting to your unique cognitive style over time.

### Natural Flow
Information and tools emerge naturally when relevant to your current thoughts and fade gracefully when no longer needed. The system preserves your state of flow rather than interrupting it, feeling more like an enhancement to your natural thought process than a separate interface.

### Local First
All processing happens locally on your machine, ensuring both privacy and rapid response times. Your work patterns and context remain secure while enabling the system to respond instantly to changing needs.

### Progressive Enhancement
The system provides immediate value while growing more sophisticated through use. It starts with basic but helpful functionality and evolves based on your actual usage patterns, becoming increasingly attuned to your way of thinking.

## Project Status
