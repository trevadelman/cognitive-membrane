# Cognitive Membrane: Ambient Intelligence Interface

## Vision
Cognitive Membrane reimagines how we interact with computers by creating an ambient layer of intelligence that understands and adapts to our thought processes. Instead of forcing users to translate their thoughts into explicit commands and queries, the system creates a fluid, intuitive interface that surfaces relevant information and tools naturally.

## Philosophy
Traditional computer interfaces force us to think like computers: we organize information into rigid hierarchies of files and folders, explicitly search for what we need, and context-switch between different applications and windows. This creates cognitive overhead and interrupts our natural flow of thought.

Cognitive Membrane takes a fundamentally different approach. By continuously monitoring and understanding our work context, it creates an ambient layer of intelligence that feels like an extension of our own thinking. Information and tools emerge naturally when relevant and fade away when not needed, much like how our own thoughts and memories surface in our consciousness.

## Core Principles
1. **Ambient Intelligence**: The system should understand and adapt to user context without requiring explicit interaction.
2. **Natural Flow**: Information should surface and recede naturally, following the user's thought patterns rather than interrupting them.
3. **Local First**: All processing happens locally to ensure privacy and quick response times.
4. **Progressive Enhancement**: The system should be useful from day one but become more helpful as it learns user patterns.

## Short-term Goals
1. Create a working proof of concept focused on developer workflows within VS Code
2. Demonstrate ambient surfacing of relevant code context, documentation, and past solutions
3. Establish a foundation for local context understanding using Ollama
4. Develop a subtle, non-intrusive interface for presenting insights

## Long-term Goals
1. Expand beyond code to understand and connect all types of work context
2. Create a system-wide ambient intelligence layer
3. Develop more sophisticated context understanding and prediction
4. Enable collaborative features while maintaining privacy
5. Create new paradigms for human-computer interaction based on natural thought patterns

## Technical Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Context Engine**
   - Local LLM (Ollama) for context understanding
   - File system monitoring for activity tracking
   - Knowledge graph for connecting information
   - Context history management

2. **Integration Layer**
   - VS Code extension (initial implementation)
   - System-level service for broader context
   - Application-specific plugins
   - Event processing system

3. **Interface Layer**
   - Ambient visualization system
   - Non-intrusive notification system
   - Context-aware positioning
   - Fluid animations and transitions

### Technology Stack

- **Backend**
  - Python for core services
  - NetworkX for knowledge graph
  - Ollama for local LLM
  - FastAPI for service communication

- **Frontend**
  - React for interface components
  - Canvas API for fluid visualizations
  - TailwindCSS for styling
  - VS Code Extension API

- **System Integration**
  - System-level service (Python)
  - File system watchers
  - Window management integration
  - Clipboard monitoring

## Development Approach
We follow an iterative development process, starting with a focused proof of concept that demonstrates the core value proposition. Each iteration expands the system's capabilities while maintaining the core principles of ambient intelligence and natural interaction.

See `poc_roadmap.md` for detailed implementation steps and milestones.

## Current Status
This project is in early development, focusing on creating a proof of concept that demonstrates the core concepts within a limited scope (VS Code development environment).

## Contributing
We welcome contributions that align with our core principles and help advance the vision of more natural human-computer interaction. Please review the development roadmap and core principles before submitting contributions.
